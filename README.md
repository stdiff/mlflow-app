Please read [my blog entry](https://stdiff.net/MB2019021201.html).

- You need to download the data set of 
[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- The application requires another library of mine. You can install it by the following command.
  `pip install https://github.com/stdiff/model_enhanced/archive/v0.1.zip`
  This library is automatically installed if you create a conda envrionment by using `conda.yaml`.
